## Supported Boards
The plugin supports a variety of boards, based on the MCU (processor) they have:

| Description | Examples | Flash Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Atmel ATmega 8-bit MCUs | RAMPS, Sanguinololu, Melzi, Anet, Creality, Ender, Prusa MMU, Prusa CW1 many others | [avrdude](doc/avrdude.md) |
| Atmel AT90USB 8-bit MCUs | Printrboard | [dfuprog](doc/dfuprog.md) |
| NXP LPC176x 32-bit MCUs | MKS SBASE, SKR v1.1, v1.3, v1.4, v1.4 Turbo etc. | [lpc176x](doc/lpc176x.md) |
| Atmel SAM 32-bit MCUs | Arduino DUE, etc. | [bossac](doc/bossac.md) |
| STM32 32-bit MCUs (via SD card) | SKR Pro v1.1, SKR Mini E3 v2, etc. | [lpc176x](doc/lpc176x.md) |

Please open a [Github issue](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint-FirmwareUpdater/issues) if you would like a new board or MCU to be supported. If it's a new type of board which requires hardware testing please consider making a [donation](#Donations) to help fund the costs.

## Plugin Installation
Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:
    https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint-FirmwareUpdater/archive/master.zip

Using OctoPrint's Software Update plugin you can choose one of three Release Channels to follow:

| Release Channel | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Stable (Recommended) | Updated least frequently, features are stable |
| Release Candidate | Updated when new features are ready for testing |
| Development | Updated frequently, may be unstable, used for beta-testing new features |

If you report a bug or request a new feature you will probalby be asked to test development or RC builds.

## Plugin Configuration
The appropriate flashing tool for the board type needs to be selected.  See the table in the [supported boards](#supported-boards) section to choose the appropriate method.

**Note:** If your board is updated by copying a file named `firmware.bin` to the SD card and resetting the board, you should use the **lpc176x** method.  This applies to SKR Pro v1.1 or SKR Mini E3 v2 boards and probably others.

### Board-Specific Configuration
Plugin settings vary depending on the flashing tool and are documented on the page for each flash method. Follow the instructions on the appropriate page to install and configure any necessary tools:
* [Atmega (AVR) based boards](doc/avrdude.md)
* [AT90USB based boards](doc/dfuprog.md)
* [LPC176x and other boards which are updated from the SD card](doc/lpc176x.md)
* [SAM based boards](doc/bossac.md)
* [STM32 based boards which do not update from the SD card](doc/stm32flash.md)

## Flashing Firmware
Once the plugin is configured, flashing firmware is a simple operation:
1. Select the COM port to communicate with the board
1. Select a firmware file, either located on the filesystem or via a URL
1. Click the appropriate **Flash from** button
1. Wait for the firmware update to complete

## Advanced Options
### Customizing the Command Lines
The command lines for `avrdude`, `bossac`, and `dfu-programmer` can be customized by editing the string in the advanced settings for the flash method.  Text in braces (`{}`) will be substituted for preconfigured values if present.

| String | Description|
| --- | --- |
| `{avrdude}` | Full path to the `avrdude` executable<sup>1</sup> |
| `{bossac}` | Full path to the `bossac` executable<sup>2</sup> |
| `{dfuprogrammer}` | Full path to the `dfu-programmer` executable<sup>3</sup> |
| `{mcu}` | MCU type<sup>4</sup> |
| `{programmer}` | Avrdude programmer<sup>1</sup> |
| `{port}` | COM port the printer is connected to |
| `{conffile}` | Full path to the avrdude configuration file<sup>1</sup> |
| `{baudrate}` | Serial port speed<sup>1</sup> |
| `{disableverify}` | Switch to disable write verification |
| `{firmware}` | Path to the uploaded firmware file |

1. avrdude flash method only
2. bossac flash method only
3. dfu-programmer flash method only
4. avrdude and dfu-programmer flash methods

#### Command Line Defaults
Command lines can be returned to the default by clicking the **Reset** button.

##### Avrdude
`{avrdude} -v -q -p {mcu} -c {programmer} -P {port} -D -C {conffile} -b {baudrate} {disableverify} -U flash:w:{firmware}:i`

##### Bossac
`{bossac} -i -p {port} -U true -e -w {disableverify} -b {firmware} -R`

##### Dfu-programmer
Erase: `{bossac} -i -p {port} -U true -e -w {disableverify} -b {firmware} -R`

### Pre and Post-flash Settings

The flash sequence is:
1. Execute the pre-flash system command(s) on the host
1. Send the pre-flash gcode commands(s) to the printer
1. Pause for the pre-flash gcode delay
1. Disconnect the printer
1. Execute the firmware update
1. Pause for the post-flash delay
1. Execute the post-flash system command(s) on the host
1. Reconnect the printer
1. Send the post-flash gcode command(s) to the printer

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Pre-flash System Command| Specify a system command or script to run on the host prior to flashing.  Multiple commands can be separated with a semicolon. |
| Pre-flash Gcode | Specify gcode commands to run on the printer prior to flashing.  Multiple commands can be separated with a semicolon.  **Commands are only run if the printer is connected when flashing is initiated** |
| Pre-flash Gcode Delay | Delay after sending pre-flash gcode. Allows time for code to complete before initiating flash. |
| Post-flash Delay | This setting can be used to insert a delay of up to 180s after the firmware has been uploaded.  This can be useful if the board takes some time to restart.  A delay of 20-30s is usually enough. |
| Post-flash System Command | Specify a system command or script to run on the host after flashing.  Multiple commands can be separated with a semicolon. |
| Post-flash Gcode | You can use the post-flash gcode settings to run gcode commands after a successful firmware flash.  The post-flash code will run more or less immediately if the printer was connected before the flash started (so reconnects automatically when the flash finishes), or whenever the printer is manually reconnected after the firmware is flashed. |

### Plugin Options
| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Enable Navbar Icon | Enables an icon in the OctoPrint Navbar which can be used to quickly access the Firmware Updater. |
| Remember URL | The last URL will be remembered when using 'Flash from URL. |

## Troubleshooting
Log messages can be found in the OctoPrint log `octoprint.log` and the Firmware Updater's console log `plugin_firmwareupdater_console.log`.  

Both log files can be downloaded from OctoPrint's logging interface, found under 'Logging' in the settings page.

If you have trouble using the plugin please check these logs for any error messages.  If you need help, please include both logs when reporting a problem.
